# Daily-Transaction-Dashboard
Built an interactive Daily Household Transactions Dashboard in Power BI to track personal finances. The report ingests transaction data (date, mode, category, subcategory, amount) and delivers actionable insights — total income & expense, net savings, category and payment-mode breakdowns, MTD/YTD figures, MoM & YoY growth, and cumulative spend. Cleaned and modeled data with Power Query and a proper Date table, authored dynamic DAX measures (including a slicer-driven dynamic Income/Expense measure), and designed multi-page reports with synchronized slicers and bookmarks for an intuitive user experience. Result: a compact, visual tool to spot spending trends and make data-driven budgeting decisions.

📊 Project Insights

Discounted courses (particularly those between 50–75%) attract the highest enrollments, showing that pricing strategy directly impacts reach.

Instructor influence is significant — about 60% of total revenue is generated by the top 10 instructors.

Course duration and review count both contribute to visibility and overall revenue growth.

Monthly enrollment trends show steady growth after promotional campaigns, emphasizing the value of periodic marketing.

Beginner-level courses dominate enrollments, indicating a higher demand for foundational finance knowledge.
