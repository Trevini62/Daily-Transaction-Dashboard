I’m excited to share my latest Power BI project — a Daily Household Transactions Dashboard designed to help monitor and analyze everyday income and expenses with clarity and precision.

Managing personal finances can be challenging, so I built a dashboard that converts routine transaction data into actionable insights through clean visuals, DAX measures, and an easy-to-navigate layout.

🛠 Tech Stack

Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, visualization & reporting

Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

DAX Functions – Calculated measures for income, expenses & balance

Excel/CSV – Source data

Bookmark Navigator – Seamless multi-page navigation

Wireframe Design – Planning the dashboard structure

📊 What the Dashboard Delivers

✔ Total Income, Total Expenses & Net Balance

✔ Category-wise Expense Breakdown

✔ Monthly Trend of Spending & Earnings

✔ Daily Expense Tracking

✔ Payment Mode Analysis (UPI, Cash, Card)

✔ Interactive Slicers for category, month, status, and payment type

✔ Dedicated pages for Summary, Expense Deep-Dive, Income View & Category Insights

This dashboard improves visibility into spending patterns and supports smarter financial planning — a simple idea that can make everyday life more organized.
